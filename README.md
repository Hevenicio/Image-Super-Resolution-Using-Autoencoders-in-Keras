# Image-Super-Resolution-Using-Autoencoders-in-Keras

## Project Description

Hands on project on using Keras with Tensorflow as a backend to train your own autoencoder and use this deep learning autoencoder to significantly improve the quality of images.

## Project Structure

- Project Overview and Import Libraries,
- What are Autoencoders?,
- Build the Encoder,
- Build the Decoder to Complete the Network,
- Create Dataset and Specify Training Routine,
- Load the Dataset and Pre-trained Model,
- Model Predictions and Visualizing the Results.
